Small areas will begin to fill in during application throughout the \nyear, larger areas may require aeration+overseeding. \n\u2022\nThin and bare areas were observed in your lawn during today's application. These areas will begin to fill in throughout the year. Adding a \nlight layer of topsoil/compost can help this process. \n\u2022\nI noticed heavy shade is currently affecting the health of your lawn. Consider limbing up some trees to allow additional sunlight and maintain \nhealth of your lawn. \n\u2022\nThank you for your business! Please keep an eye out for a message following today's application containing a link to our post-service survey."
