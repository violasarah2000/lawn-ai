This treatment will also control any broadleaf weeds in the lawn. \nAllow 7-21 days for weeds to begin to curl. \nWHAT I NOTICED\n\u2022\nI noticed some areas of your lawn are greening up faster than others. Your lawn should green up more evenly as it warms up. \nWHAT I RECOMMEND\n\u2022\nWater as needed to promote greenup as temperatures increase. Environmental conditions as well as different grass types in a lawn will affect \ngreen up. \n\u2022\nIn the absence of rain supply one-half to 1 inch of water 1 to 2 times weekly. A rain gauge or even a tuna can will make a good measuring \ndevice. \n\u2022\nPlease water in today's application with 1/2 inch of irrigation if rain is not forecasted for best results. \n\u2022\nStay off of areas until treatment has dried. \n\u2022\nThank you for choosing TruGreen.
